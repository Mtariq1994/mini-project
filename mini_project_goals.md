#Mini Project Goals

My Actions:
- Review Week4 Miniproject X
- Work through goals steadily on week_4_working.py X 
- use reusable functions, refactor app from week 4 with all of this help.X 
- Start week 5

Task list breakdown:
-   [X]Refactored products part of app into csv
-   [x]Refactored Couriers part of app into csv
-   [x]Refactored orders part of app into csv
-   []Review Miniproject 5 for next steps:
- Week5:






- Sort out all folders, make neat
! DONT FORGET TO Commit to Git


Aesthetics of app:
OS / TIME
I would like the orders and products to print more line by line if possible, looks better

WEEK 5 Breakdown:
NOTE: adminer interface is localhost:8080
^Create a new database there
0. Use SQL W3 For database commands


cheatsheet for databases shows how to make database in localhost
0a)have a seperate tab
example file, read stuff from DB see if it works
NOTE: see printing lists as tabular data on SO, pretty table for example
0b)have a seperate tab where i do sql

See database excercises and their implementation for examples


1. view and add products from the database
    a. create a table called products
    b. the table should have columns for all of our data [make each one suitable like some are int some are var char etc]
        (similar to our csv columns)
    c. our program should be able to read all of the data from the 
        table and display it in the console
    c2. we can test looking at the products, using the adminer
        interface
    d. our program should be able to take user input and add
        a product to the product table
    d2. we can test inserting new products, using the adminer
        interface
    e. we should no longer need the products csv or txt file

2. view and add couriers from the database
(same as above, but for couriers)

[] for my own project i wanna use sql and python together, think about if i can do one alongside group project
