#Mini Project Goals

My Actions:
- Review Week4 Miniproject
- Work through goals steadily on week_4_working.py
- use reusable functions, refactor app from week 4 with all of this help.

Task list breakdown:
-   [X]Refactored products part of app into csv
-   [x]Refactored Couriers part of app into csv
-   []Refactored orders part of app into csv
-   []Review Miniproject 4 for next steps:

- [] Begin week5

- Sort out all folders, make neat
! DONT FORGET TO Commit to Git


Aesthetics of app:
OS / TIME
I would like the orders and products to print more line by line if possible, looks better
