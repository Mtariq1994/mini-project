#Mini Project Goals

My Actions:
- Review Week4 Miniproject X
- Work through goals steadily on week_4_working.py X 
- use reusable functions, refactor app from week 4 with all of this help.X 
- Start week 5

Task list breakdown:
-   [X]Refactored products part of app into csv
-   [x]Refactored Couriers part of app into csv
-   [x]Refactored orders part of app into csv
-   []Review Miniproject 5 for next steps:
- Week5:






- Sort out all folders, make neat
! DONT FORGET TO Commit to Git


Aesthetics of app:
OS / TIME
I would like the orders and products to print more line by line if possible, looks better



[] for my own project i wanna use sql and python together, think about if i can do one alongside group project

week6
- get functionality between orders running
- If it don't work or not enough time, get week5 looking like week 6, nice and presentable with good comments.
- Can always come back to project later.

Post-project thoughts for revision:
- Study hard every single day now and be able to use SQL and basics of python
